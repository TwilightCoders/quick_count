# QuickCount

Unfortunately, it's currently notoriously difficult and expensive to get an exact count on large tables.

Luckily, there are [some tricks](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/12/count-performance) for quickly getting fairly accurate estimates. For example, on a table with over 450 million records, you can get a 99.82% accurate count within a fraction of of the time. See the table below for an example dataset.

**Supports:**
- PostgreSQL
  - [Multi-table Inheritance](https://github.com/TwilightCoders/active_record-mti)

| SQL | Version | Result | Accuracy | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SELECT count(*) FROM small_table;` | -- | `2037104` | `100.0000000%` | `4.900s` |
| `SELECT quick_count('small_table');` | `v0.0.5` | `1988857` | `97.63158877%` | `0.048s` |
| `SELECT quick_count('small_table');` | `v0.0.6` | `2036407` | `99.96578476%` | `0.050s` |
| `SELECT count(*) FROM medium_table;` | -- | `81716243` | `100.0000000%` | `257.5s` |
| `SELECT quick_count('medium_table');` | `v0.0.5` | `79352284` | `97.10711247%` | `0.049s` |
| `SELECT quick_count('medium_table');` | `v0.0.6` | `81600513` | `99.85837577%` | `0.048s` |
| `SELECT count(*) FROM large_table;` | -- | `455270802` | `100.0000000%` | `310.6s` |
| `SELECT quick_count('large_table');` | `v0.0.5` | `448170751` | `98.44047741%` | `0.047s` |
| `SELECT quick_count('large_table');` | `v0.0.6` | `454448393` | `99.81935828%` | `0.046s` |
